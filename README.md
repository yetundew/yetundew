- 👋 Hi, I’m @yetundew
- 👀 I’m interested in crocheting, salsa dancing, and astrology.
- 🌱 I’m a full time flight attendant who is currently learning JavaScript in my free time! (Just for fun:))
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new media art projects that are beginner friendly. Those are super interesting to me and I used to enjoy my classes on the subject. My favorite artist is Claudia Maté.
